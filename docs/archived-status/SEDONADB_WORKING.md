# SedonaDB Integration - Status

**Date**: November 1, 2025 12:40 AM  
**Status**: üü° Partially Working - Needs Simpler Test

## What's Working ‚úÖ

1. **SedonaDB Installed**: `apache-sedona[db]` loads perfectly
2. **Tasks Registered**: All SedonaDB tasks are in Celery worker
3. **Imports Fixed**: Added `chain` to imports
4. **Orchestrator Works**: `load_gadm_sedonadb` task executes and returns workflow ID

## Issue üîç

The orchestrator task succeeds but the **chord workflow doesn't execute child tasks**.

```
Task ID: 64e32bf8-df3c-4a59-9ef0-8eb3a7ae6df8
Status: SUCCESS
Info: {'workflow_id': '43a94e67-66d6-40b7-81b4-47b146437e5f', ...}
```

But workflow ID `43a94e67` never appears in logs - the child tasks never run.

## Next Steps

Try simpler approach - test one SedonaDB preprocessing task directly instead of full chord:

```bash
python manage.py shell
from locations.tasks import preprocess_gadm_layer_sedonadb
result = preprocess_gadm_layer_sedonadb.delay(0, 'Admin_Level_0', '/path/to/gadm.gpkg')
```

If that works, the issue is with the chord/chain composition, not SedonaDB itself.

## Fallback

If chords don't work, we can use simple sequential execution which is still faster than current GeoPandas approach due to SedonaDB's Arrow optimization.

**Current Time Invested**: ~3 hours  
**Core Value Delivered**: SedonaDB infrastructure ready  
**Remaining**: Test simple task execution, then debug workflow composition
